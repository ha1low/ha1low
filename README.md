⌍ABOUT⌎

I am Matvei. I specialize in cybersecurity operations, combining offensive and defensive methodologies to expose weaknesses and engineer resilience. My work focuses on real-world application: if it doesn’t work under pressure, it’s irrelevant.

Currently studying in Moscow polytechnic university and RSSU college. Participating in various events hosted by top universities of Moscow.
